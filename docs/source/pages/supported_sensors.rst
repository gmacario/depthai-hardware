Supported sensors
=================

DepthAI firmware has to have sensor configuration in order to support the given camera sensor. Currently, we support sensor configurations out-of-the-box
(in firmware) for the camera sensors listed below. It's possible to use a different camera sensor, you just need to provide sensor configuration yourself.

..
    Add docs/link about adding custom sensor configuration here.
